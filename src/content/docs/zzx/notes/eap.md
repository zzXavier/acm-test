## Transitioning from High School to University: Key Factors for a Successful Adjustment
## Introduction
A smooth transition from high school to university is crucial for students. While university presents both challenges and opportunities, how can students effectively navigate this new environment and adapt successfully? This essay will explore two key factors that can enhance students’ transitions: managing expectations and building social relationships. By focusing on these pivotal elements, students can experience improved behaviors and achieve a more successful and less stressful adjustment to university life.


Managing expectations is a crucial factor for students adjusting to the transition from high school to university. The perceptions students develop during their first semester can be critical in their decision to continue or discontinue their studies (Bowles et al., 2014). Freixa highlighted, "My best friends are older than me, and when they went to university, they shared a lot of experiences. You see things like tiered lecture theatres in American movies, but when you get here, it can feel even more overwhelming than secondary school because hardly anything fits in the desk you've been given" (Freixa-Niella et al., 2019). It's essential to manage our expectations, as the transition from high school to university can be a daunting psychosocial experience for many students (Setlalentoa, 2013). The goals of study in high school and university differ significantly. By effectively managing our expectations, we may empower ourselves to study more effectively. Therefore, learning how to manage our expectations is extremely important.


If we view managing expectations as an inner factor, building social relationships will be viewed as an outer factor. I assume that social relationships can be built between classmates, roommates, or even professors. "They made smart choices—they applied all the strategies that other studies also identified: they made the right friends, attended all their classes, asked questions and spoke to the lecturers inside and outside of classes and made use of consultation." (McGhie, 2016) Whoever we build relationships with, we must ensure we get good feedback so that we can learn advantage from them. The ability to build a network of peers can significantly influence a student's emotional well-being and academic success. Because when we feel lonely, we can always find hope. Moreover, students who feel socially integrated are more likely to feel a sense of belonging, which is linked to higher retention rates and better academic outcomes (Bowles et al., 2013).


Transitioning to university is a complex process. It has many factors so that we can better transition. Not only does it involve academic adjustments but also personal growth. Managing expectations is essential and closely linked to resilience and adaptability. Building social relationships is also important for emotional well-being and a sense of community. The two factors are interconnected. For instance, students who feel socially connected tend to have more positive expectations about their university life. Good luck to everyone who joined the university this year. Embrace this new chapter with confidence and enthusiasm—your future is bright!
